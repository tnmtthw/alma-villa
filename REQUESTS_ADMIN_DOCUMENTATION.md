## Mock Data
Currently uses mock data for demonstration. In production, this should be connected to:
- Database API for fetching requests
- File storage for attachments and payment proofs
- Email notification system
- PDF generation service

## Navigation Integration
- Already integrated in admin navigation (`components/admincomponents/AdminNav.tsx`)
- Shows badge with pending request count
- Accessible via sidebar menu

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
2. **Email Notifications**: Automated emails for status changes
3. **PDF Generation**: Automatic document generation
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Request volume, completion rates, etc.
5. **Bulk Operations**: Mass approve/reject multiple requests
6. **Template Management**: Customizable document templates
7. **API Integration**: Connect to actual database and file storage

## Usage
1. Navigate to `/admin/requests` from the admin panel
2. Use filters and search to find specific requests
3. Click on any request to view details or update status
4. Review payments when users submit payment proofs
5. Track request progress through the workflow

The system provides a complete solution for managing the document request workflow from submission to completion, with comprehensive tracking and management capabilities.
